Hi, fellow netizen and welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm glad you found this blog and I guess I'm also glad you want to know something more about me.

My name is Paolo Ricciuti and I come from a small city in Italy, I have ~ `new Date().getFullYear() - 1989` years.

I have a computer science degree and I started developing when I was 17 years (with PHP 4 ðŸ˜±).

Nowadays I work at [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com) as Fullstack Senior Software Engineer.

I love Svelte ðŸ§¡ and I'm fortunate enough to work with it. I'm also one of the Svelte Ambassadors. As of September of 2024 i've also joined the svelte core team as a maintainer so you'll likely see me around in the svelte github repo.
