Hi, fellow netizen and welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm glad you found this blog and i guess i'm also glad you want to know something more about me.

My name is Paolo Ricciuti and i come from a small city in Italy, i have ~ `new Date().getFullYear() - 1989` years.

I have a computer science degree and i started developing when i had 17 years (with PHP 4 ðŸ˜±).

Nowadays i work at [Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com) as Fullstack Senior Software Engineer.

I love Svelte ðŸ§¡ and i'm fortunate enough to work with it. I'm also one of the Svelte Ambassadors.
